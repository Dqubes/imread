Welcome to imread's documentation!
==================================

Imread is a very simple libray. It has three functions

imread
    Reads an image from disk
imread_multi
    Reads multiple images from disk (only for file formats that support
    multiple images)
imwrite
    Save an image to disk

That's it.

For actually using these images for anything, checkout computer vision & image
processing packages:

- `mahotas <http://luispedro.org/software/mahotas>`__
- `scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org/>`__
- `OpenCV <http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/>`__
